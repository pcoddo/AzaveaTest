# AzaveaTest
Last updated: 3.12.17


This document contains the responses to the Data Analysis test for the Junior Data Analyst position at Azavea. 
My answers are written in *italics*, and the code used to generate the analyses are embedded as `R code blocks`. 
You should be able to run the code directly through R Studio, but I have included a code-only version in case this doesn't work. 

R version: 3.3.3
Required packages:
* GGally
* ggoplot2
* tidyr
* class
* rpart
* rpart.plot

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  

Thank you for this opportunity,  
Perry
