## Part 2: Applied Question
**For this second applied question you will develop several predictive models. These should be written in R or Python and the code should be submitted. The models will predict whether a car will get high or low gas mileage. The question will be based on the Cars_mileage data set that is a part of this repo.**

**(a)** Create a binary variable that represents whether the car's mpg is above or below its median. Above the median should be represented as 1. Name this variable **mpg_binary.**

```{r}
# Clear all variables
rm(list = ls())

# Set seed
set.seed(8675309)

# Read read mileage data into new data frame
df = read.csv("Cars_mileage.csv", header = T, sep = ",", na.strings = '?')

# Add variable for median mileage
df$binary_median = NA

# Apply binary classification
df$binary_median = sapply(1:length(df$mpg), function(x){
  
  if(df$mpg[x] >= median(df$mpg)){
    return(1)
    
  } else {
    
    return(0)
  }
  
})

```


**(b)** Which of the other variables seem most likely to be useful in predicting whether a car's mpg is above or below its median? **Describe your findings and submit visual representations of the relationship between mpg_binary and other variables.**

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Reformat categorical variables
catVar = c("cylinders", "year", "origin", "name", "binary_median")
for(i in catVar){
  df[,i] <- as.factor(df[,i])
}

### Pairs plot showing variable relationships
# Load required packages
require(GGally)
require(ggplot2)

# Subset predictor variables to plot
dfPlot <- subset(x = df, select = c("mpg", "displacement", "horsepower", "weight", "acceleration", "year", "binary_median"))
```
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Produce plot
#png("Figures/Figure1_pairsPlot.png", width = 6.5, height = 6.5, units = 'in', res = 150)
f1 <- ggpairs(dfPlot,
              mapping = ggplot2::aes(color = binary_median),
              upper = list(continuous = wrap("density", alpha = 0.5), combo = "box"),
              lower = list(continuous = wrap("points", alpha = 0.3), combo = wrap("dot", alpha = 0.4)),
              diag = list(continuous = wrap("densityDiag")),
              title = "Figure 1. Vehicle variable pairs plot")
f1
#dev.off()
```

**(c)** Split the data into a training set and a test set.

**(d)** Perform two of the following in order to predict mpg_binary:
